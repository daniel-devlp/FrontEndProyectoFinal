/**
 * Authentication Type Definitions
 * 
 * Comprehensive type definitions for authentication, authorization, and user management
 * throughout the application. These types ensure type safety and consistency
 * across all authentication-related operations.
 * 
 * Key Areas Covered:
 * - User authentication and authorization
 * - Role-based access control (RBAC)
 * - JWT token management
 * - User registration and management
 * - Session state management
 * 
 * Security Considerations:
 * - Password fields are optional for security (not included in responses)
 * - Token expiration handling
 * - Role-based permission validation
 * - User state management for authentication flows
 * 
 * Usage Context:
 * - Used throughout authentication flows
 * - Integrated with auth services and hooks
 * - Supports role-based routing and permissions
 * - Compatible with JWT-based authentication
